# DAMS (Digital Asset Management System)

## Todo List for the App

### Design

1. **Design the Layout of the Media Upload Screen:**
   - create the UI of the screen
   - Determine the arrangement of UI elements where users will upload media files

2. **Consider How to Display Selected Media Files and Additional UI Elements for Progress Indication:**
   - Decide on the method for displaying the list of selected media files
   - Consider incorporating UI elements such as progress bars to provide feedback on the upload process

### Implementations

3. **Implement Media Selection using image_picker:**
   - Integrate the image_picker package to select images or videos
   - Ensure the selected data are displayed appropriately on the screen for user review

4. **Implement Media Upload using video_uploader:**
   - Integrate the video_uploader package to handle the upload of selected media files

### Additional Considerations

5. **Testing:**
   - Test the app on various devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness
   - Verify the reliability of the upload process, handling scenarios such as poor network conditions or large file sizes

7. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle errors that may occur during media selection, compression, or upload
   - Provide clear and informative error messages to guide users in case of failures
